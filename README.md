### Intro: The journey begins.

Currently decided to learn a new skill after seeing a Wednesday motivation tweet on how to tackle boredom. I choose web development because it was one of the skills listed in the tweet that caught my attention. You can also follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/blockchaintron).

### Day 1: November 11. 2018

Started the day with watching a tutorial on how to clone a webpage. Then proceedd to freecodecamp to finish the CSS curriculum. What i have learnt so far is a lot and im trying find a way to master them. I also started the #100DaysofCode challenge nine days ago, and you can track my progress here and on twitter, the link is in the intro.

### Day 2: November 12. 2018

Finished two projcets from Free Code Camp, the survey form and tribute project which i dedicated to Fela Kuti. Spent most of my day doing that, and if felt good finishing both task. Also started watching a video about Javascript, it was 3 hours long and i surprised myself and sat through it. The topics covered were challenging, not as easy to understand as HTML and CSS. Its probably due to the fact that i am completely new to the language, and although it might have a steep learning curve, i am bound to triumph over it. Im certain once i look back after dedicating so many hours to it, it would be worth it.

### Day 3: November 13, 2018.

Finished my landing page project for free code camp. It took me a while and i learnt a lot in the process. I just need to keep practicing everyday on code pen, and just build stuff that comes to my head randomly. Also watched a video on CSS grid, i hated it at first, but when he broke it down, i think its way better that flex box. But for me to master it, i need to keep using it every day. Last thing for today is to watch another tutorial on javascript, it looks like its going to be a challenging program for me, but im determined.

### Day 4: November 14, 2018.

Finished my "Technical Documentation" project for free code camp which can be seen [here] (https://codepen.io/blockchaintron/pen/jQBgWY). The project took me awhile but learnt alot along the way. I started the Javascript course on Solo-Learn, the way its broken down makes it easy for me to follow as opposed to just watching video tutorials on youtube. I will stick to this learning style for now.  Like i said earlier, it looks like it would take more than a month to learn Javascript and i am williing to be patient.


### Day 5: November 15, 2018.

Today i started with Head First Javascript book, got through some pages, but did not get through enough because i had to go to work. While at work, i managed to finish the personal portfolio project, my last project for the Responsive Web Design course at Free Code Camp. Then i proceeded to continue the Javascript course on Solo Learn website. So far i understand variables, assignments (=), strings, booleans and numbers. When i learnt html and css, i watched video tutorials and understood the concepts after couple of videos, but its the opposite for Javascript. I am understanding the concepts when i study from a book or  follow steps from a free online course as opposed to video tutorials, i guess its probably due to the learning curve, but im just glad that im understanding the basics so far. 

### Day 6: November 16, 2018.

Today i was off from work so i was able to spend a lot of time studying and coding Javascript. Most of my day was just going through the first chapter of Head First Javascript and then did some activities on the SoloLearn website. Im getting a better understating of variables, and the different primitive types (Numbers, Booleans, and strings). I know that variable names are not allowed to have strings, and also know that there has to be a semicolon after every line. I learnt about console.log, and how you can write code in the browser and its purpose is for debbuging and fixing errors. Lastly we are only allowed to start variables with letters, dollar-sign (This is not reccomended), and underscores. I feel like i accomplished a lot today and also feel great knowing that two weeks ago, i did know what an html was. With this pace im going, the future is bright.

### Day 7: November 17, 2018.

Started the day with Head first javascript. Learnt about psuedocode and how it can help you write well written code. Also learnt about prompts, another kind of alert that opens a dialog box in browser, pretty much another way to communicate with the user. Logical and comparison operators can be written more than one way, and thats all i learnt before i went to work, and i was fortunate enought to continue learning Javascript on SoloLearn. Learnt about objects and creating your own objects. Also object initialization and adding methods. I will have to go over this again, seem like i did not understand the concepts. I would probably have to elaborate on both logical and comaprison operators. 

### Day 8: November 18, 2018.

Began the day with following a html and css tutorial on youtube on how to create blur effects on a typical landing page. Spent approx. 4 hours working on that, and i ended up using the finishing product for my personal web site [here](https://oluadeleye.io). Spent the other half of the day working on the head first javascript book. Built a "battleship" game on the browser, learnt about math.floor and how its used to round up numbers to their intergers, basically makes math.random() better because the later built in javascript function only computes numbers between 0 - 1 with decimals in it. So far, today was a productive day.
