### Intro: The journey begins.

Currently decided to learn a new skill after seeing a Wednesday motivation tweet on how to tackle boredom. I choose web development because it was one of the skills listed in the tweet that caught my attention. You can also follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/blockchaintron).

### Day 1: November 11. 2018

Started the day with watching a tutorial on how to clone a webpage. Then proceedd to freecodecamp to finish the CSS curriculum. What i have learnt so far is a lot and im trying find a way to master them. I also started the #100DaysofCode challenge nine days ago, and you can track my progress here and on twitter, the link is in the intro.

### Day 2: November 12. 2018

Finished two projcets from Free Code Camp, the survey form and tribute project which i dedicated to Fela Kuti. Spent most of my day doing that, and if felt good finishing both task. Also started watching a video about Javascript, it was 3 hours long and i surprised myself and sat through it. The topics covered were challenging, not as easy to understand as HTML and CSS. Its probably due to the fact that i am completely new to the language, and although it might have a steep learning curve, i am bound to triumph over it. Im certain once i look back after dedicating so many hours to it, it would be worth it.

### Day 3: November 13, 2018.

Finished my landing page project for free code camp. It took me a while and i learnt a lot in the process. I just need to keep practicing everyday on code pen, and just build stuff that comes to my head randomly. Also watched a video on CSS grid, i hated it at first, but when he broke it down, i think its way better that flex box. But for me to master it, i need to keep using it every day. Last thing for today is to watch another tutorial on javascript, it looks like its going to be a challenging program for me, but im determined.

### Day 4: November 14, 2018.

Finished my "Technical Documentation" project for free code camp which can be seen [here] (https://codepen.io/blockchaintron/pen/jQBgWY). The project took me awhile but learnt alot along the way. I started the Javascript course on Solo-Learn, the way its broken down makes it easy for me to follow as opposed to just watching video tutorials on youtube. I will stick to this learning style for now.  Like i said earlier, it looks like it would take more than a month to learn Javascript and i am williing to be patient.


### day 5: November 15, 2018.

Today i started with Head First Javascript book, got through some pages, but did not get through enough because i had to go to work. While at work, i managed to finish the personal portfolio project, my last project for the Responsive Web Design course at Free Code Camp. Then i proceeded to continue the Javascript course on Solo Learn website. So far i understand variables, assignments (=), strings, booleans and numbers. When i learnt html and css, i watched video tutorials and understood the concepts after couple of videos, but its the opposite for Javascript. I am understanding the concepts when i study from a book or  follow steps from a free online course as opposed to video tutorials, i guess its probably due to the learning curve, but im just glad that im understanding the basics so far.
