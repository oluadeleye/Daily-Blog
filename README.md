# Daily-Blog

Intro: Currently decided to learn a new skill after seeing a Wednesday motivation tweet on how to tackle boredom. I choose web development because it was one of the skills listed in the tweet that caught my attention. 

Day 1: 
Started the day with watching a tutorial on how to clone a webpage. Then proceedd to freecodecamp to finish the CSS curriculum. What i have learnt so far is a lot and im trying fins a way to master them. I also started the #100DaysofCode challenge nine days ago, and you can track my progress here and on twitter:@blochchaintron.
